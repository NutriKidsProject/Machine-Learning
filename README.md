### Project Overview: Nutrition Status Prediction and Food Recommendation Models

This project aims to combine two machine learning models to provide a comprehensive solution for assessing children's nutritional status and recommending suitable food and drinks to improve their health. Below is a detailed breakdown of the models and the technologies used.

---

### **Technologies Used:**
1. **Programming Language:**
   - Python
2. **Libraries and Frameworks:**
   - **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
   - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (LabelEncoder, train_test_split, MinMaxScaler, classification metrics)
   - **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM, Dense layers)
   - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. **Storage and Deployment:**
   - Google Colab and Google Drive for model storage and deployment.

### **1. Nutrition Status Prediction Model**

#### **Purpose:**
- To predict the nutritional status of children (e.g., "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight") based on their **age**, **height**, and **weight**.

---

### **2. Food and Drink Recommendation Model**

#### **Purpose:**
- To recommend suitable food and drink items based on the nutritional needs of children and nutrient composition of available foods.
